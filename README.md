# TinyFloat
## **WORK IN PROGRESS**

Soft 32 bit floating point implementation, a pretty abnormal one.
There are plenty soft floating point libraries in the wild, I am not satisfied with either of those.
All of them are way too complex.

This is a tiny project, the goal is to make a **simple and understandable** implementation of single-point floating point precision numbers.
I do not care about efficiency as long as the code is simple.
I'll write a complete series of articles covering all bits of the code.
